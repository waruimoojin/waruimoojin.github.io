My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio, built with simple HTML and Tailwind CSS, and hosted on GitHub Pages.

How to Update Your Portfolio

This site is designed to be very easy to update. Just follow these steps.

Step 1: Replace the old index.md

Your old file is named index.md. The new portfolio page is an index.html file.

In your GitHub repository, delete the index.md file.

Click the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".

Name the new file index.html (it's important to use .html).

Copy the entire content from the index.html file I provided and paste it into this new file.

Commit the new file.

Step 2: Customize Your Content

Open the new index.html file in GitHub and click the "Edit" (pencil) icon. You can now change any of the text to match your information.

Look for these sections to customize:

<title> tag: Change the title of the website in the <head> section.

Hero Section: Update your name and the title under it (e.g., "DevOps Engineer & Web Developer").

Project Cards: You can change the descriptions for each project to be more detailed.

About Me Section: Write a few paragraphs about yourself, your skills, and your interests.

Contact Section:

Find the link for LinkedIn (<a href="#" ...>). Replace the # with your actual LinkedIn profile URL.

You can add an email link if you want, like this:

<a href="mailto:youremail@example.com">Email Me</a>


Step 3: Commit and Wait

After you save (commit) your changes, wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild your site. Then, visit your URL to see the beautiful new portfolio!
